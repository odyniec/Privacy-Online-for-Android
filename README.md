Privacy Online for Android
==========================

Native Android companion application for the privacy.online VPN service.

This is the Open Source codebase for the Privacy Online for Android application,
if you just want the app for your device, head on over to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com)
and install the lastest build for free.

This repo is the complete Android Studio project for the application, so getting
set up in the IDE should be easy.

This application's OpenVPN service backend is based on [OpenVPN for Android](https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn)
by Arne Schwabe. Thanks to Arne for making his work Open Source and saving
us from having to re-invent the wheel.

Some of the codebase is "as-is" from OpenVPN for Android, some is heavily
modified. None of the UI code is from Arne's project. Only the GPLv2 licenced
parts have been used, and we're releasing our entire app's source to honour that
licence.

Do check out [OpenVPN for Android](https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn) if
you're looking for a configurable OpenVPN app for your Android device.
